#Todo app in Flux style
A very simple ToDo app written with react-js and Flux style architecture.
##How to get started?
Run this at the root dir of the project: 
    
    #!bash
    npm install npm run build-js

Then, point your browser to "index.html" in root dir

While doing dev work, kickoff the watchify script to automate build step 
    
    #!bash
    npm run start
